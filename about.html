     <h1>Biography</h1>
         <p>My story begins in September 1988 in the rainy city of Portland, OR. Originally, I received a Bachelors’ degree in Business Management from Oregon State University, and had received my first job with Apple Inc working with their online-based sales team. My employment came at the height of the debut of innovative devices like the iPad and their new Retina-display enabled devices, which proved excellent timing for my growing interests in art and design.</p>
         <p>As I was being exposed to these devices on a regular basis, as well as customizing solutions for design professionals, I gained a greater interest of the many tools available to artists and designers of all levels. It was so much so, that I began doing freelance artwork and logo design for local businesses, with many of my skills inherited by self-teaching.</p>
         <p>Desiring to grow further in my artistic abilities on the internet, I enrolled in Bloc.io's Designer Apprenticeship program to inherit these needed skills. With the guidance of my talented mentors, I gained greater knowledge of design aesthetic and color theory, as well as the most important concepts in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With this newfound knowledge, I was ready to make a career change, and departed from Apple to fully pursue my amibitions of becoming a full-time Website and UI Designer.</p> 
         <p>It’s been over seven years that I have been cultivating my skills in both art and design, and I find that my desire for growing as a designer still thrives and the field of Website and UI Design is no longer just a field I want to pursue for employment, but is a field that has become one of my greatest passions.</p>

      <h1>My Favorite Hobbies</h1>
         <p>When not behind my workstation, you can often find me on weekends in the North End of Providence Park cheering on the Portland Timbers Major League Soccer team. I am a season-ticket holder, and enjoy the thrill and energy that comes from the beautiful game.</p>
         <p>I am also an avid fan-artist and writer. What does that mean exactly? Well, if there's a Television, Anime, or Video Game character or scene that captures my interest, I can't help but get inspired to draw or write it out. I often find it cathartic and a great way to keep my skills sharpened as an artist and writer.</p>
       	 <p>But of course, I am always acquiring new hobbies each day, because who doesn't love trying new things?</p>
